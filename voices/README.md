# Voices

All the recording training voices and voice models for speaker voice recognition are stored here. This is pretty cool because it can identify who is speaking just by the voice of the speaker if the speaker is registered in the software.
But you don't have to worry about it since it is a bit complicated. But if you really really want to try this out, just go the the main directory and take a look at the voice.py file. If you can understand it and able to run it then YOU ARE WORTHY. Otherwise, again just don't worry about it.
