# Crystal Language Model

This is the revolutionary part of the entire CRYSTAL project. This is the part where Crystal processes your query, runs it through a neural network and then outputs an AI generated text, just like ChatGPT from OpenAI. But the goal is to make it even better.
I am not sure whether this code even works because I do not have access to the computational resources required for such a computation intensive task. For me it will take approximately 254 years to train 0.001% of the minimum data required for optimum results. But as soon as the training is done, I will be able to improve this by adjusting the training factors on each training sequence.
If you have access to this repository, then I assume you are one of my friend because I am not sure how many people are looking for an AI named Crystal. So if you want to understand how to run this for obtaining the results, just message me and I will provide you the steps.
