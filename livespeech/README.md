# livespeech

This program allows live ASR without the need of external paid programs, thank me later. But this does require a really good computer to run effectly with, and I mean a REALLY GOOD computer. It's pretty straight forward, just run the main.py file and it should work. If you get any modules errors then just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` command in the previous directory or just contact me with the methods listed in the main directory's README file if you have any other questions.
